## 🔍 Overview

ElectricityShop is a modern e-commerce platform that follows industry best practices and Clean Architecture principles. The application provides a complete shopping experience with product browsing, cart management, order processing, and user account functionality.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project implements Clean Architecture with the following layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Core business entities and interfaces
- **Application Layer**: Business logic and use cases using CQRS pattern
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns like data persistence and messaging
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for client applications

The application also implements CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for better separation of read and write operations.

## 💻 Technology Stack

- **Backend**:
  - .NET 9 with ASP.NET Core
  - Entity Framework Core (ORM)
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - JWT Authentication
  - RabbitMQ for messaging

- **Frontend Options**:
  - React web application
  - Flutter mobile app
