# Build Fixes for ElectricityShop Project

## Issue Analysis

The main issues identified in the ElectricityShop project were:

1. **Circular Dependency**: The Application project was referencing Infrastructure (for ApplicationDbContext), and Infrastructure was referencing Application.

2. **Missing Entity Framework Core Extensions**: Queries were using async methods without proper namespace imports.

3. **Expression Tree Limitations**: The code included calls with optional arguments in expression trees.

4. **Incomplete OpenTelemetry Integration**: Missing necessary OpenTelemetry packages.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Resolved Circular Dependency with Clean Architecture Pattern

- Created an `IApplicationDbContext` interface in the Application project
- Updated the concrete ApplicationDbContext in Infrastructure to implement this interface
- Fixed project references:
  - Application now only references Domain, not Infrastructure
  - Infrastructure references both Domain and Application
  - API references both Application and Infrastructure

### 2. Refactored Query Handlers

- Updated GetProductsQueryHandler to use the interface instead of the concrete implementation
- Replaced compiled queries with direct LINQ queries for better compatibility with interfaces
- Ensured all async methods include CancellationToken parameters

### 3. Enhanced Infrastructure Services Registration

- Registered ApplicationDbContext as an implementation of IApplicationDbContext in DI container
- Used Scoped lifetime for the database context

### 4. Added OpenTelemetry Packages

Added the latest .NET 9 compatible versions of OpenTelemetry packages (all using consistent version 1.11.1):
- OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting
- OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore
- OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http
- OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Runtime
- OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Process
- OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.EntityFrameworkCore
- OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console
- OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol

## Improved Architecture

The project now follows a cleaner architecture pattern:

- **Domain**: Contains entities and core business logic
- **Application**: Contains interfaces, DTOs, and use cases (depends only on Domain)
- **Infrastructure**: Implements interfaces from Application (depends on both Domain and Application)
- **API**: Web interface that uses all layers (depends on both Application and Infrastructure)

This approach allows for better separation of concerns and easier testing, as the Application layer is now free from infrastructure concerns.

## Next Steps

1. Test the build to ensure all errors are resolved
2. Run the application to verify functionality
3. Complete the OpenTelemetry integration with proper middleware configuration
4. Consider adding automated tests to validate the new architecture
